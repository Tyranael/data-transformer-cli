# Data Transformer CLI

Small personal project to practice:
- Python fundamentals
- simple data transformations
- clean Git workflow

## Goal
Build a minimal CLI tool that applies small transformations to text-based data.

This project focuses on clarity and structure rather than performance or advanced features.

## MVP (work in progress)
- single transformation at a time
- text input (direct or file)
- output to stdout or file

## Usage (planned)

Examples of how the CLI is expected to be used:

dt trim "   hello   "

dt to_csv --in data.txt

dt trim --in raw.txt --out clean.txt


Details will be refined incrementally.
