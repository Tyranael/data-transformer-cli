# Data Transformer CLI

Small personal project to practice:
- Python fundamentals
- simple data transformations
- clean Git workflow

## Goal
Build a minimal CLI tool that applies small transformations to text-based data.

This project focuses on clarity and structure rather than performance or advanced features.

## MVP (work in progress)
- single transformation at a time
- text input (direct or file)
- output to stdout or file

Details will be refined incrementally.
